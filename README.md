✨ Introduction
This project implements a simple yet powerful Task Management System using React. Users can easily manage their tasks, ensuring better productivity and efficient task tracking. The application features include:

Creating tasks with a title, description, and priority.
Marking tasks as complete or incomplete with a simple click.
Filtering tasks by status: All, Completed, or Incomplete.
Sorting tasks by creation date or priority for better organization.
Viewing task details on a separate detail page.
Persisting tasks using localStorage so data is saved even after page reloads.
💻 Setup and Run Instructions
To get started with this project on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/abhic92/react-task-management.git
cd react-task-management
2. Install Dependencies
Next, install the necessary dependencies with npm:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
3. Run the Application
Now, start the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
Your application should now be running at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

4. Open the App
Once the app is running, open it in your browser. You can now add, manage, filter, and delete tasks as per the features described below!

🛠️ Features
Here’s what you can do with this Task Management Application:

Create, Update, and Delete Tasks: Add new tasks, mark them as completed or incomplete, and remove them from the task list.
Task Completion: Simply click on any task to toggle its status between complete and incomplete.
Task Filtering: Filter tasks by All, Completed, or Incomplete status to quickly organize your tasks.
Task Sorting: Sort tasks by Creation Date or Priority to easily prioritize what’s most important.
Task Detail Page: Click on any task to view detailed information about it in a separate page.
Persistence with LocalStorage: Your tasks are saved in the browser’s localStorage, so they persist across page reloads.
💡 Approach and Thought Process
🔧 Modular Components
I broke down the application into reusable components to keep the code clean and manageable. Components such as TaskForm, TaskList, TaskItem, TaskFilters, and SortOptions ensure flexibility and reusability. This modular approach makes the app easy to maintain and extend in the future.

🌐 State Management
I used React’s useState hook to manage the state for tasks, sorting options, and filters. The useEffect hook is used to load tasks from localStorage when the component mounts, ensuring the data persists across reloads.

🔄 Routing
React Router was used to create two essential pages:

HomePage: Displays the task list.
TaskDetailPage: Displays detailed information about the selected task. This clean routing structure makes the application easy to navigate.
📱 Responsive Design
To ensure that the app is usable on any device, I made sure it is fully responsive, adapting smoothly to both mobile and desktop screens using CSS media queries.

⚙️ Tools Used
React: The main JavaScript library for building the UI.
React Router: Used to implement routing between the Home page and the Task Detail page.
PropTypes: For prop validation to ensure the correct data is passed to components.
localStorage: To persist tasks even after page reloads.
Jest / React Testing Library: For unit testing and ensuring the application behaves as expected.
Optional Tools / Libraries:
CSS/SCSS: I used plain CSS for styling (feel free to use SCSS or Tailwind CSS if preferred).
🧪 Testing
To run the unit tests for this project, follow the steps below:

Ensure all dependencies are installed:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Run the tests with:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm test
This will start Jest and run the test cases to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

🌟 Optional Features
Drag-and-Drop Task Reordering: This feature can be added for more intuitive task management, allowing users to reorder tasks easily.
Animations: Smooth transitions (like fade-in/out) for task additions or deletions can be implemented to enhance the user experience.
📝 Notes
Make sure to test the following:
All core features (task creation, updating, filtering, sorting, deleting) are functional.
The app is responsive on both mobile and desktop screens.
The app’s performance should score 90+ on Google PageSpeed Insights for both mobile and desktop.

Final Thoughts:
This project provides a clean and modern way to organize and manage tasks with flexibility and ease. The use of React, localStorage, and React Router makes the app scalable and easy to extend with additional features in the future.
